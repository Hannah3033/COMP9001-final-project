# 🃏 Blackjack Game 
This project is a text-based Blackjack card game implemented in Python. The player competes against a computer-controlled dealer. The game follows traditional Blackjack rules.

# 🎯 Game Rules
- The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
- J, Q, K are worth 10 points.
- Ace (A) is worth 11 or 1, depending on which is more favorable.
- The player can choose to:
  - `Hit` → draw a new card
  - `Stand` → stop and keep current hand
- The dealer must automatically draw cards until their total reaches at least 17.
- If a player or dealer goes over 21, they bust and lose.
- If both stand and have equal value, the result is a draw (Push).
